# EKYC_Fast_api
This project enables live validation for E-KYC by confirming a person's physical presence. Users follow on-screen instructions, such as blinking or moving, which are analyzed in real-time using computer vision techniques. This ensures the individual is live, preventing fraud and enhancing the security and compliance of the E-KYC process.
